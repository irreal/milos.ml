If you are a software developer, there is approximately zero chance that you don't already know some english.

In fact more than likely, you know enough english to read through most forums threads, stack overflow Q&As and tutorials. You can also follow along any video tutorials you encounter.

Then one day you have to actually interact with another human being in english. It may be your boss, a client, a stake holder or a colleague. After the first few times of heavy sweating and increased heartbeat, you got used to it, and now you can get through any type of conference call. You even understand _most_ of what is being said.

That's it, you now know enough english to be able to do your work and you never have to worry about that again, right?

Well, I don't think so. In fact, I would strongly argue that most software developers who don't use english as their first language, should value practicing it as much as they value practicing code testing or source control.



## Does anyone really care, as long as they can understand me?

I believe so. Most people will be nice to you, most people will not say to you that they think less of you because you're not fully fluent or have a thick accent. In fact, I'm an optimist, so I'll say most people probably aren't even consciously aware of the bias they have. But nevertheless I'm quite certain that really poor english skills are holding you back.

If people are struggling to piece together what you are trying to say, they will most likely stick to the big picture. Any finer details of your point will be lost along the way. 

People might also try to dumb things down when speaking with you, or skip out on details.

What is absolutely certain is that you will have a far tougher time forming a deeper connection with them, socializing and taking the whole working relationship to the next level.

Getting better at english will also make you feel more confident and allow you to focus more on the point you are making.

## 

## All of this applies only if I actually work with native English speakers, right?

Well, yeah, that's true. But these days you'd be really hard pressed to find a job that requires zero interaction with english speakers. Be that native english speakers or simply people around the globe who don't share your language, you are bound to use english sooner or later.

Even if you most definitely have zero need to speak english at your current position, there are good chances that you will change jobs or change what you do, and also good chances your next job _will_ require speaking english. So why not start preparing now?



## So how do I get better?

My main advice is to try and listen.

I personally know a bunch of great software developers who speak mediocre english at best, and even though they are exposed to both native english speakers as well as more skilled colleagues every day, they never improve, not one bit.

Most likely, they simply aren't giving it any thought. That could be the mistake holding their careers back.

One good tip is to record yourself. The next time you have a chat in english, just record yourself. Heck, you can even start recording and just talk by yourself for the sole purpose of evaluating where you are.

Then compare that to a native person speaking.

Try and spot the differences in tone, melody, timing, pacing, pronunciation and grammar.

As long as you are actively thinking about what mistakes you are making, you can make a conscious effort to correct those mistakes the next time, soon enough the correct way should start sounding better to you, and you'll automatically switch to it.



I'm not going to expand further on language learning techniques, the internet is full of articles, tutorials, apps, videos and what nots for language learners. My main goal was to argue that "good enough" is not good enough.





## Disclaimer

There are bound to be errors in this blog post. Maybe even basic ones. I'm sure there's some dodgy grammar here and there.

I am definitely not a native english speaker. My primary language is serbian, and I even suck at that at times. I'm a self taught english speaker. When i was a little kid I watched a lot of cartoon network with no subtitles, and I started using a PC. Both were not possible without english, so I had little choice but to learn. I later made an effort to pay close attention to english in every movie, tv show or cartoon I watched, picking up on the subtleties of the language.

I'm not saying my english is perfect by any stretch of the imagination, nor that everyone should simply copy what I am doing. I'm just giving my perspective as someone who has worked a lot with both native and non native english speaking devs.

Also, this post was made with a hefty dose of automatic spell checking built into Chrome. Thanks, google :)

I have been in development for well over 10 years. Ever since the beginning, I've come upon the same advice over and over again "write a blog".\
And I tried, numerous times with numerous intents. It never stuck.

So how is this one different?

This time around, it wasn't exactly my idea to write a blog.

But let's take a step back.

The story starts some time ago, when I became obsessed with reading about development every day. I joined [Medium](https://medium.com/) and every day I go through my daily digest looking for relevant articles to read through. 

I'm a big believer in self improvement, even if I don't actively practice it all that much.

One day, amidst my mix of various programming related articles, I stumbled onto one that talked about habits. I was immediately intrigued.

## The power of habits

The article talked about how good habits are the key to getting energy, increasing productivity and generally rocking at life.

The article was somewhat short, and not that well planned (much like this blog post), but it did point me towards a book called [Superhuman by Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Superhuman-Habit-Becoming-Possible-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00NGC8I9E) 

I immediately got the book and started reading.

I'm still partway through the book, but I'm totally sold on the power of habits.

To someone who always had trouble finding the will to persevere with boring or tedious tasks, the idea has huge appeal.

In theory, all I have to do is load up a habit, using what little will power I had, then it would set in, I would reap all of the benefits of it, while my will supposedly regenerated like mana on an RPG character, and I would have the power to add more and more good habits as I go along. I could level up and keep progressing, making "the game" easier and easier.

So what do habits have to do with starting a new blog?

## The blog

One of the excellent habits, the book tells us, is writing a blog.

Supposedly, it doesn't matter how good you are at it, it doesn't matter what you write about, all that matters is that you sit down each day and write.

I'm willing to try it. I'm not saying I'm gonna stick with it, but if I didn't at least try it, I would feel like I'm passing an excellent opportunity to improve myself and make life easier going forward.

And really, it's 2019, who doesn't need a quick and easy way to make their life easier :)

## Topics I'll write about

The book tells us to just write. It doesn't matter what you write about, just sit down and write. Every. Single. Day.

I'd like to think most of my topics will be technical and programming oriented, but with my non-existent writing experience and so far non-existing habit of writing, I can't afford to limit myself.

So, I'll do what the book says: write about anything. When I'm stuck not knowing what to write about, I'll write about not knowing what to write about.

At least I hope I will.

Time will tell if this is the one that actually takes off.

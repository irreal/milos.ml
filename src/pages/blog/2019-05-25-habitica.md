One of the first stops on my journey into exploring good habits is Habitica. I have heard about Habitica a couple of times before, but not being a big RPG fan I wasn't intrigued enough to give it a shot.

This time I felt I really want to give my best shot at developing good habits, and the person that set me down this path highly recommended Habitica, so I felt there was no option but to download the app and dive right in.



## Getting started and first impressions

I started with the iOS app. Upon downloading, I had the option to sign up with my google account, an always much appreciated feature, as I really dislike filling out the same basic personal info over and over again.

Upon registration, I was quite pleased by the aesthetic of the app, as well as the seemingly simple UI that I encountered. The onboarding wizard didn't have too many steps and everything was laid out quickly.

I am the type of person that easily gets overwhelmed with free to play apps and games that hit you right off the bat with a million different currencies, concepts, skill trees and menu items.

I have quit a lot of apps and games in the first 5 minutes of using them due to the incoherent and overcomplicated UI.

So it was a real breath of fresh air when I finished the simple onboarding process and was greeted by an equally simple main UI screen that houses the different sections of the app.

A helpful guide displays basic info on each section when you click on it, allowing you to take your time and have it all sink in.

Two thumbs up for the first impression.

I later found that there is quite some complexity in the rest of the UI, once you get deeper into items, shops, challenges, quests, party, guilds... ðŸ˜©

But luckily, you're not hit over the head with that stuff immediately and can get to the core of the experience without much in your way.



## The core experience

Habitica, despite what it's name might imply doesn't focus squarely on habits alone, it gives equal importance to recurring tasks that you can set up (daily, weekly, monthly type of stuff) as well as any and all one-off todo items that you come up with.

Those three types, Habits, Dailies, Todos are the alfa and omega of Habitica.

Don't let the name "Daily" fool you, they can be setup to recur daily, weekly, monthly and you can even get into complex scenarios such as having something recur every second, third day or even specific days of the week. Very nice.

The app comes pre setup with some good ideas in each of these categories, and yet more ideas are easily found in the Wiki pages, accessible through the FAQ section. I was able to quickly get up to speed in all categories.



## Results so far

For most types of habits, the 4 days I've been using the app thus far aren't nearly enough to get the habit fully formed and start reaping benefits. But I was surprised just how much I thought about Habitica during the corse of my normal day and how much it already altered my behavior.

Now, truth be told, I am currently pumped and hyped up about the power of habits, and there's really not much evidence that I'll be able to keep my enthusiasm going forward, but so far my impressions are generally rather positive.

One of my bad habits that I wanted to put down is that when ever I'm not doing anything with my hands, I automatically start picking my nails and the skin around them. Ironically, I really hate seeing someone bite their nails, but using one hand to pick the nails on the other hand has somehow become my every day routine. This has led to a lot of pain, bleeding fingers and general ugly look.

So naturally the first thing I setup in Habitica was a button to indicate I've succumbed to a bad habit, which immediately knocks out some serious HP from my hero.

4 days in, I haven't shaken the automatic impulse to start picking my nails quite yet, but I do now catch myself doing it within just a couple of seconds, which is huge progress. I'm then able to go into the app, administer the HP hit, and inch closer to stopping myself before I actually start the bad habit.



## Available platforms and technical talk

The app is available on both iOS and Android, which is rather convenient, considering the party aspect, where you team up with friends. I heard about Habitica in the context of  a mobile app for habits. But I was very pleased to find that it also has a nice web UI, which makes great use of high resolution displays and shows everything on one screen without much clutter. I now always keep Habitica open in a pinned tab in chrome for desktop usage, but I also keep checking in from the iOS app to check off those items or punish myself for bad habits.

Not everything about Habitica is good. And while it's obvious they  really focused  on the gamification aspect of the whole deal, there was an obvious lack of focus on modern technologies and the smoothness of the UX.

The app, neither web nor iOS won't refresh on its own, it always waits for you to click on something before pulling the latest data. In case you did a lot of stuff on a different device, it's really jarring to click on something only to have a bunch of stuff disappear, new stuff appear, etc.

The web interface is especially slow as any sort of change, even reordering items in a list causes a big loading cycle, progress bar and all. Making it tedious to quickly make bigger changes in your lists.



## Conclusion

So far so good! I joined a party with my close friend and we set off on a quest to kill some dust bunnies. We are both trying harder to be mindful of our habits and choices and we pick away on our todo lists, each item bringing us one step closer to ending this quest and starting another.

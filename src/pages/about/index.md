### A long time in Development

Computers have always intrigued me. I started messing with a computers before I could even reach the keyboard. By the age of 6, my journey into making computer software had started.

From those humble beginnings, a life story was formed.

When I turned 18, I was already doing freelance development work for a couple of companies. Two years later, I landed a full time developer position and my career officially started.

### Where I am now

For the last 5 years, I've been in the position of Team Lead / Lead Software Engineer, where I bring technical value to the team, working as the core part of the development team, but also looking at the bigger picture. Planning product roadmaps, giving ideas to product owners, hearing them out and evaluating their ideas. All around being involved in designing the products and solutions my teams are working on.

Going forward, my sights are set squarely on CTO type positions. I am definitely going to be one of those CTOs that gets close to the action.\
Now, I don't think an executive's time is best spent working on specific development tasks. But a CTO that stays up to date with development practices, researches new tools and approaches, holds technical talks and champions quality and maintainability is a powerful prospect in my mind.

### Past experience

Back in the day, I started by creating simple console apps. Writing algorithms was all nice and dandy, but my hunger for emulating great software I had used quickly led me to VisualBasic 4 and my first WinForms projects. After a brief stint with the then hot and new WPF, I started looking more seriously into web development. Web was no longer this silly collection of pages you would create in MS FrontPage, but was quickly becoming THE place for innovation and powerful new apps.

I wanted in.

Transitioning to ASP.NET was a logical next step, and I had the joy of working with great teams on some serious web applications.

After some time, I realized mobile apps were a large part of the application ecosystem that I had very little experience with, so using Xamarin, I was able to pick up on all the good Android and iOS stuff, learning both Java+Kotlin and Swift along the way, at least enough to deeply understand the platform, that is.

All the while working  on various .NET applications on different platforms, I kept an eye other languages and methodologies too. I never liked sticking with one vendor, one way of thinking, one way of doing things.

The next chance I had, I dove straight into the Javascript ecosystem. I have kept diving and exploring to this day. After all, Javascript is a seriously big ocean.

After tackling all the JS things, on the backend (Node + Express, Apollo), web (Vue, Angular, React), mobile (ionic, nativescript), I can really say I'm hooked.

I contribute to open source, I obsess over choosing the right npm module, I optimize my builds processes and a good CI/CD architecture really gives me that butterflies in the stomach feeling.

Lately I've been checking out Go and Rust, just so that I get a feeling for their strengths and weaknesses, and can know when is the right time to reach for them.

Lest you think that is all I have experience with, I'll have you know I've also worked as a database analyst, writing and optimizing MS SQL and Oracle queries, creating reports and tools. I'm a certified MongoDB developer. I've dabbled with C, C++, Python, Ruby, Lua, I've created multiple games first in GameMaker, then in Unity, I've done 3D modeling and animation (poorly), I tinkered with a Raspberry Pi.

I have run code on every device I ever owned that had the ability to run user code, including an Android Wear watch, Apple Watch, Samsung TV, iPad, iPhone, Android phone, windows CE tablets, barcode scanners, multiple cars and a robot toy.

I play development games, I read about development, I listen to developer podcasts, I live and breathe software development.

I love it from start to finish. I just know that every nook and cranny of this huge ecosystem is hiding some amazing nugget of knowledge that unlocks the next level of productivity and power, and I'm going to look inside each and every one.
